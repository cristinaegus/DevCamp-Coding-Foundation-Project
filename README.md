# DevCamp-Coding-Foundation-Project 
This is a Coding Foundation Project, made for may DevCamp Course of HTML and CSS, this project duplicates a CodePen Hompage using a screeshot they provide.
Not all the functionality features work because they do not ask me to, they say just duplicate the page.
I had some issues with the placement of some of the elements of the page, and the fonts maybe are not the correct ones but the are some alike.
I have place all the files on this 
github
